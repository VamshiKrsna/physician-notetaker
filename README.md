You can find Spacy Implementation for Task 1 <a href= "https://github.com/VamshiKrsna/physician-notetaker/blob/main/Task1Spacy.py"> here</a> 

Spacy Implementation was good enough, but it lacked better summarization for prognosis and current_state


Tried Task 1 with Gemini Model, you can find it <a href= "https://github.com/VamshiKrsna/physician-notetaker/blob/main/Task1Gemini.py"> here </a>


This one obviously performs in the best way as it is using a SOTA Model.
